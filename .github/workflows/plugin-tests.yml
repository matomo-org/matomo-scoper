# Action for running GoogleAnalyticsImporter tests
#
# This file was copied from the matomo-tests.yml workflow in the GoogleAnalyticsImporter plugin with the
# following changes:
# - the name of the suite was changed to "Matomo Plugin Tests"
# - the push to branches trigger was set to just 'main'
# - the concurrency group was changed to plugin-${{ github.ref }}
# - for the PluginTests job, the target attribute was removed from the matrix and the matomo-test-branch
#   for the run tests step was changed to 'maximum_supported_matomo'
# - the following attribute was added to matomo-org/github-action-tests steps
#   setup-script: .github/scripts/run-scoper.sh
# - the following step was added after the checkout action of each job:
#
#   - shell: bash
#     run: ${{ github.workspace }}/.github/scripts/setup-plugin-tests.sh
#     env:
#       WORKSPACE: ${{ github.workspace }}
# - the following schedule was added (from a pluguin's tests workflow)
#
#   schedule:
#     - cron: "10 3 * * 6"
